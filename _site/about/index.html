<p>Oh hey there, My name is Ivonneg! You have found my slowly developing portfolio. Well, while you're here let me tell you a little about myself.</p>

<p>I am currently living in Chicago, studying at DePaul University. Attending DePaul has to be one of the best decisions I have made. It is one of the only univeristies that offers User Experience Design. So from that, you can guess what I'm studying. Designing, coding and research have been a long time passion of mine.</p>

<p>My site is like half and half a portfolio and a blog. I will be sharing my work, but within describing my experience. If throughout your reading you come across any feedback please email me! So enjoy getting to know me!</p>
